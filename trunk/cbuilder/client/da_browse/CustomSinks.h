// TCustomSink template class

/*

Notes on using the TCustomSink template class:

1- Define a COM object based on ATL, which should derive from
   CComObjectRootEx (or CComObjectRoot). You can use the ATL 
   object wizard to do this. 

2- The object should implement the events custom interface. Use 
   the wizard as properly (or typing) to add the corresponding code.

3- The object normally should be hidden and noncreatable in the IDL.
   Therefore, add those attributes to the coclass declared in the IDL.
   In code, comment (or erase) the object entry in the COM map, which 
   should be in the main file of your COM server, to avoid creation 
   through the Class Factory.

4- Declare the creatable sink as follows:

     typedef TCustomSink<CMySink, &IID_IMyEvents> CMyCreatableSink;
   
   CMySink in this case is the class you previously created using the
   wizard (or your typing skills), wich implements the custom interface 
   IMyEvents, meaning the custom event interface. 

5- Declare a member on your host class:
   
     CMyCreatableSink m_sink;

6- Use the members Connect and Disconnect as needed. When connected, the
   server will call, on the sink, the methods of the custom events interface
   the sink implements. That interface is actually an outgoing interface in the
   server.

7- Keep as a pattern having one sink per event interface. The name "Event Sink"
   suggest so.
