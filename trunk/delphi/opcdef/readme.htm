  <h1>Delphi OPC Programming</h1>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>This document, and the ZIP archive of which it is part, are intended to
  help give a brief introduction to OPC (formerly OLE for Process Control)
  development using Embarcadero (formerly Borland) Delphi.</p>

  <p>The ZIP file contains Delphi translations of the published OPC custom
  interfaces, i.e. OPC Common 1.1, Data Access 3.0 (and earlier), Alarms &amp;
  Events 1.10, Historical Data Access 1.2 and Security 1.0.</p>

  <p>The code has been confirmed to be compatible with with Delphi 3 to 7, and
  Delphi 2005 to 2010 for Win32.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.opcconnect.com/delphi.php">Delphi page</a> at OPC
  Programmers&#39; Connection also has Delphi source code for a demo OPC client
  and server.</p>

  <h3>Version History</h3>

  <p><b>September 2nd 2009:</b> Confirmed compatibility with Delphi 2010 (no
  code changes).</p>

  <p><b>October 5th 2008:</b> Confirmed compatibility with Delphi 2009 (no code
  changes).</p>

  <p><b>December 11th 2003:</b> Added error codes for Complex Data 1.0. Added
  OPCHDA_PARTIAL quality for HDA 1.2.</p>

  <p><b>March 10th 2003:</b> Updated for Data Access 3.0.</p>

  <p><b>October 31st 2002:</b> Added support for new OPC Alarms &amp; Events
  1.10 interfaces: IOPCEventServer2 and IOPCEventSubscriptionMgt2.</p>

  <p><b>October 22nd 2002:</b> Added support for new OPC Common 1.1 interfaces:
  IOPCServerList2 and IOPCEnumGUID.</p>

  <p><b>September 13th 2002:</b> Added support for OPC Security 1.0 (unit
  contributed by <a href="mailto:ikysil@ua.fm">Illya Kysil</a>).</p>

  <p><b>September 6th 2002:</b> Corrected OPC_WRITABLE to OPC_WRITEABLE in
  OPCDA.pas.</p>

  <p><b>September 3rd 2002:</b> Minor changes for compatibility with Delphi
  7.0.</p>

  <p><b>August 6th 2002:</b> Updated OPCHDA.pas to correct declaration of
  IOPCHDA_SyncRead.ReadAttribute (thanks to Arjan Lamaker for pointing out the
  error). Also updated Internet addresses in file header comments.</p>

  <p><b>July 26th 2002:</b> Updated OPCHDA.pas to explicitly declare const
  CATID_OPCHDAServer10 as a TGUID.</p>

  <p><b>July 22nd 2002:</b> Updated OPCDA.pas with corrected item property IDs
  (200 to 207) from Data Access 2.05A specification.</p>

  <p><b>July 5th 2001:</b> Confirmed compatibility with Delphi 6.0 (no code
  changes).</p>

  <p><b>June 20th 2001:</b> Added support for OPC Historical Data Access 1.1
  (with help from <a href="mailto:ikysil@ua.fm">Illya Kysil</a>).</p>

  <p><b>June 19th 2001:</b> Removed unneeded IID_IEnumString declarations.</p>

  <p><b>March 7th 2001:</b> Pascal type definitions modified for all interface
  input parameters which are of array types. This is to more accurately
  indicate the required data. As a consequence, any client which implements the
  IOPCDataCallback interface will need minor code changes.</p>

  <p>Factored out common type definitions into new file OPCtypes.pas; this
  should be added to the uses list of all source files which make use of OPC
  interfaces. This change is needed to avoid compilation errors when using the
  Data Access and Alarms &amp; Events interfaces from the same unit.</p>

  <p>Definition removed for type PWORDARRAY to prevent possible conflict with
  the Delphi SysUtils unit.</p>

  <p><b>October 26th 1999:</b> Extra type definitions added to OPCDA.pas, for
  use with connection points.</p>

  <p><b>October 12th 1999:</b> OPC interface files and sample client program
  now packaged separately.</p>

  <p><b>September 11th 1999:</b> Now works with Delphi 3, 4 and 5.</p>

  <p><b>June 22nd 1999:</b> Original version, compatible with Delphi 4.</p>

  <h3>Converting the OPC Definitions</h3>

  <p>In each case, the initial conversion of the OPC interfaces was performed
  using Delphi&#39;s standard &#39;Import Type Library&#39; function,
  specifying the relevant proxy/stub DLL as the type library file. This results
  in a set of definitions which works correctly for the most part, but is not
  entirely satisfactory. There are several reasons for this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>In some cases, certain type name information is missing from the type
    library itself. For example, using Microsoft&#39;s OLE/COM Object Viewer to
    examine the Alarms &amp; Events type library reveals that most of the
    struct and enum types have had their original names replaced with names
    auto-generated by MIDL. The original type names have therefore been
    manually retro-fitted.</li>

    <li>There currently appear to be some minor problems with Delphi&#39;s
    ability to import non-automation type libraries.</li>

    <li>In the original C and IDL files, the relevant declarations are
    distributed among several different files. For example, the CATIDs for Data
    Access 2.0 are defined separately from the other DA 2.0 GUIDs. It is
    helpful to combine some of these files to reduce the number of Pascal units
    which are required.</li>

    <li>There is scope for improving the layout and readability of the files
    auto-generated by Delphi.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

  <p>Some of the work of porting the OPC interfaces to Delphi was performed
  initially while working at Eurotherm Limited. Their cooperation in allowing
  this code to be published is gratefully acknowledged. The <a href=
  "http://www.eurotherm.com/itools/">iTools</a> suite of applications from
  Eurotherm includes several OPC client programs developed using Delphi.</p>

  <p>Thanks are also due to the many Delphi OPC developers who have contributed
  ideas, suggestions, and corrections.</p>

  <h3>Disclaimer</h3>

  <p>Although every effort has been made to faithfully convert the original C
  and IDL declarations to Delphi, and the results have been used and tested
  extensively, I can&#39;t of course actually <i>guarantee</i> their
  correctness. Neither will I be held responsible for any loss or damage
  arising from their use.</p>

  <p>I would be grateful to know of any problems with these files.</p>
